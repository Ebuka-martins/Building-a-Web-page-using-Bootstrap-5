            <p>Ireland is an island nation in northwestern Europe, known for its rich history, stunning landscapes, and vibrant culture. It is divided into two parts: the Republic of Ireland, which covers most of the island and is an independent country, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.
                The Republic of Ireland's capital is Dublin, and its official languages are Irish (Gaelic) and English. Ireland is known for its lush green landscapes, earning it the nickname "The Emerald Isle." Its history is marked by ancient Celtic culture, Christian heritage (notably through figures like St. Patrick), and a long struggle for independence from British rule, achieved in 1922 for most of the island.
                Ireland has a rich cultural heritage, particularly in literature, music, and folklore. Famous writers like James Joyce, W.B. Yeats, and Oscar Wilde hail from Ireland. Traditional Irish music and dance, such as the jig and the reel, are celebrated worldwide.
                The economy is modern and developed, with key sectors in technology, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture. It is also known for its hospitality, pubs, and the iconic St. Patrick’s Day celebrations.</p>
